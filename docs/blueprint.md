# **App Name**: GridRecall

## Core Features:

- Grid Configuration: Configurable grid (3x3 to 5x6) using Expo's UI elements. Allows users to select a grid size for their memory game.
- Sequence Logging: Logs button presses, visually marks them with numbering, and displays the current step in the sequence using React Native components.
- Reset Button: A button that resets the sequence using React Native state management.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333333) for the background to support dark mode.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for text and borders to ensure readability in dark mode.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for highlights, button presses, and active states to provide visual cues.
- Use a grid layout for the buttons, adapting to different screen sizes and grid configurations.
- Minimalist icons for the reset button and step indicators to maintain a clean interface.
