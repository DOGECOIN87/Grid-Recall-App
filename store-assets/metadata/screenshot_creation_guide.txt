# GridRecall: Screenshot Creation Guide for Google Play Store

This guide outlines the process for creating high-quality screenshots of GridRecall for the Google Play Store listing.

## Overview

Since GridRecall is currently a web application that will be wrapped in a WebView for Android, we need to create screenshots that accurately represent how the app will look on mobile devices. This guide provides instructions for creating professional-looking screenshots that showcase the app's features and UI.

## Required Screenshot Types

As specified in `screenshot_specifications.txt`, we need:

1. **Phone Screenshots (Required)**
   - Format: JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha)
   - Recommended dimensions: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16)
   - Quantity: 2-8 screenshots

2. **Tablet Screenshots (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Format: JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha)
   - Recommended dimensions: 
     - 7-inch: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16)
     - 10-inch: 1920 x 1200 pixels or 2560 x 1600 pixels
   - Quantity: 2-8 screenshots per size

## Screenshot Creation Methods

### Method 1: Using Device Frames (Recommended)

This method involves capturing the web app in a browser and then placing the screenshots inside device frames.

#### Tools Needed:
- Browser (Chrome recommended for mobile emulation)
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
- Device frame templates (available online)

#### Steps:

1. **Capture Raw Screenshots**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Click the "Toggle Device Toolbar" button (Ctrl+Shift+M)
   - Select a mobile device preset (e.g., Pixel 5)
   - Set the app to the desired state (e.g., main screen, grid selection, etc.)
   - Capture screenshot (In DevTools: â‹® menu > "Capture screenshot")
   - Repeat for all required app states

2. **Apply Device Frames**
   - Open your image editing software
   - Import a device frame template
   - Place your raw screenshot inside the device frame
   - Adjust as needed to fit properly
   - Export as PNG or JPEG at the required dimensions

3. **Add Text Overlays (Optional)**
   - Add short, descriptive text highlighting the feature shown
   - Use consistent font, size, and positioning across all screenshots
   - Keep text brief and focused on key benefits

### Method 2: Using Android Emulator

If you've already created the Android WebView wrapper, you can use the Android Emulator for more authentic screenshots.

#### Tools Needed:
- Android Studio
- Android Emulator with appropriate device configuration
- Screenshot tool (built into Android Studio)

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Emulator**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Launch AVD Manager
   - Create or select a virtual device (e.g., Pixel 5 with Play Store)
   - Start the emulator

2. **Install and Run App**
   - Build and install your app on the emulator
   - Navigate to the desired screens

3. **Capture Screenshots**
   - Use the screenshot button in the emulator controls
   - Or press Ctrl+S in the emulator window
   - Repeat for all required app states

4. **Enhance Screenshots (Optional)**
   - Import into image editing software
   - Adjust brightness/contrast if needed
   - Add text overlays highlighting features
   - Export at the required dimensions

### Method 3: Using Online Mockup Tools

Several online tools allow you to create device mockups without advanced design skills.

#### Recommended Tools:
- [Smartmockups](https://smartmockups.com/)
- [MockuPhone](https://mockuphone.com/)
- [DeviceShots](https://deviceshots.com/)
- [AppLaunchpad](https://theapplaunchpad.com/)

#### Steps:

1. **Capture Raw Screenshots**
   - Follow the same process as Method 1 to capture raw screenshots

2. **Upload to Mockup Tool**
   - Select a device frame that matches Google Play requirements
   - Upload your screenshot
   - Adjust as needed
   - Download the final mockup

## Required Screenshots for GridRecall

4. **Step Navigation**
   - Show the step indicator with a sequence in progress
   - Highlight the current step / total steps display

5. **Reset Function**

   - Demonstrate the clear visual feedback

6. **Responsive Design (Tablet)**
   - Show how the app adapts to larger screens
   - Highlight the spacious layout on tablets

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Consistency

- Use the same device frame for all phone screenshots
- Maintain consistent lighting and background
- Use the same text style for all annotations
- Keep a consistent color scheme aligned with app branding

### Text Overlays

If adding text overlays to highlight features:

- Keep text brief and benefit-focused
- Use a clear, readable font
- Position text consistently across screenshots
- Use the app's color scheme (teal accent color)
- Ensure text doesn't obscure important UI elements

### Background Elements

- Consider adding a subtle branded background behind device frames
- Use the app's color scheme (dark blue/black with teal accents)
- Don't make backgrounds too busy or distracting

## File Naming Convention

Use this naming convention for organization:

- `gridrecall_phone_01_main_screen.png`
- `gridrecall_phone_02_grid_selection.png`
- `gridrecall_phone_03_playback.png`
- `gridrecall_phone_04_step_navigation.png`
- `gridrecall_phone_05_reset.png`
- `gridrecall_tablet7_01_main_screen.png`
- `gridrecall_tablet10_01_main_screen.png`

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing screenshots:

- [ ] All screenshots meet Google Play size requirements
- [ ] UI elements are clearly visible and not cut off
- [ ] Text is readable and free of spelling/grammar errors
- [ ] Images are sharp and not pixelated
- [ ] Consistent visual style across all screenshots
- [ ] Key features are highlighted effectively
- [ ] No sensitive/personal information is visible
- [ ] Device frames are consistent (if used)
- [ ] File sizes are optimized for web

## Additional Tips

- **Show Real Usage**: Capture screenshots that show the app in use with realistic data
- **Highlight Unique Features**: Focus on what makes GridRecall special
- **Consider Localization**: If planning to release in multiple languages, create separate screenshots for each language
- **Test Different Devices**: Check how screenshots look on various screen sizes
- **Get Feedback**: Have others review your screenshots before submission
- **Check Competitors**: Look at similar apps for inspiration (but don't copy)
