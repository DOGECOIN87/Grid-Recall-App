# GridRecall APK Creation

This directory contains the necessary files to create a personal APK for your GridRecall app.

## Files Included

1. **gridrecall-web.zip** - This zip file contains the exported static web files of your Next.js application. These files will be included in the Android WebView wrapper to create your APK.

2. **create-apk-guide.md** - A comprehensive step-by-step guide that walks you through the process of creating an Android APK using Android Studio.

## Quick Start

1. Download both files to your local machine
2. Follow the instructions in `create-apk-guide.md` to create your APK

## Requirements

- Android Studio (latest version)
- JDK 11 or newer
- Basic knowledge of Android development

## Support

If you encounter any issues during the APK creation process, refer to the troubleshooting section in the guide or consult Android Studio documentation.

## Note

This approach uses a WebView wrapper to package your web application as an Android app. While this is a quick way to create a mobile app from a web application, it may not provide the same level of performance or native feel as a fully native application. For production apps intended for wide distribution, consider exploring more advanced approaches like React Native or Flutter.
